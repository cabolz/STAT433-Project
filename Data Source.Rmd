Our goal is to compare the biogas produced from landfills to more traditional fuels such as petroleum and natural gas. Our data set for landfills can be found at this [link](https://www.epa.gov/lmop/landfill-technical-data). Our data set for petroleum and natural gas can be found at this [link](https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/natural-gas-and-petroleum-systems-ghg-inventory-additional-information-1990-2018-ghg)

Our github repository for this project can be found at this [link](https://github.com/cabolz/STAT433-Project)
